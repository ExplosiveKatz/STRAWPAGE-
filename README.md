Basic informations about myself !

Hi, I am Katz! 💥💥

I am a ponytown playerz, yea that's why your here in the first place hehz

I am a huge Katsuki Bakugo Kinner, I love him so much, and I inspo-ed my nickname based off him ! 💥

I am preferable by male pronouns only(He, Him, His) if you are going to ask for other pronouns, please do ask me.

I am apart of the LGBTQ+ community (I am pansexual to be precise), and haters of this community can kindly whisper to me and block them for unnecessary arguements.

I like to interact, I love to be with my lover, and cuddles! , just don't be weird, I don't like people disrespecting my point of views, them not respecting my friends, ESPECIALLY my lover.(I will be your enemy if you disrespect my lover.), being weird and being mean in general.
